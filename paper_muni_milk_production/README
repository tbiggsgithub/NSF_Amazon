TerraClimate is downscaled CRU data.
Resolution 4638.3 meters 

pdsi = Palmer Drought Severity Index (dimensionless, but 0.01 multiplier: divide by 100)
pet = potential evapotranspiration, Penman Monteith equation, 0.1mm/month: divide by 10 to get mm/month
srad = incoming shortwave radiation (0.1W/m2) (divide by 10 to get W/m2)
tmax = mean maximum daily temperature for each month (0.1C) (divide by 10 to get degrees C)
tmin = mean minimum daily temperature for each month (0.1C) (divide by 10 to get degrees C)

Extracted in Google Earth Engine for 2015 munis.
